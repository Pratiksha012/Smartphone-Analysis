## Data Collection

The data was scraped from Flipkart's website using web scraping techniques. The dataset includes information on various smartphones such as:

- Title
- Original Price
- Offer Price
- Stars out of 5
- Ratings
- Flipkart Assured
- Specification

## Data Preprocessing

After scraping, the dataset was preprocessed to clean and organize the data. The final dataset after preprocessing included the following columns:

- Product Name
- Original Price
- Offer Price
- Stars out of 5
- Ratings
- Flipkart Assured
- Specification
- Color
- Reviews
- Discount
- Brand
- 5G Support
- Battery (mAh)
- RAM
- ROM
- Number of Colors

## Data Visualization

Various visualization techniques were used to analyze the data:

- Scatter plots
- Pie charts
- Pair plots
- Strip plots
- Swarm plots
- Bar graphs
- Histograms
- Interactive plots using Plotly Express

## Machine Learning

Machine learning algorithms were applied to the dataset, including:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor
- Simple Linear Regression (SLR)
